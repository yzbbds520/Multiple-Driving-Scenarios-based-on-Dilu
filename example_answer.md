Well, I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible. 
I should first check if I can acceleration, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `912`. The distance between me and car `912` is 382.33 - 363.14 = 19.19 m, and the difference in speed is 23.30 - 25.00 = -1.7 m/s. Car `912` is traveling 19.19 m ahead of me and its speed is 1.7 m/s slower than mine. This distance is too close and my speed is too high, so I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can maintain my current speed. ... [reasoning continues] ...
- Now my only option is to slow down to keep me safe.
Final Answer: Deceleration
